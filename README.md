# CARE

Classical MR analyses utilizing summary data may still produce biased causal effect estimates due to the the winner’s curse and pleiotropic issues. To address these two issues and establish valid causal conclusions, we propose a unified robust Mendelian Randomization framework with summary data, which systematically removes the winner’s curse and screens out invalid genetic instruments
with pleiotropic effects. 

In this repo, we provide the following sources.

- Simulations folder: the codes for replicating simulation results in the above manuscript
- RealData folder: the codes for replicating real data results in the above manuscript

We aim to write a separate manuscript that focuses on software and pipeline development. The codes provided here (especially under the RealData folder) can provide a good template for experts using our new methods. The users may need to specify the working directory and install relevant packages to run it smoothly.
